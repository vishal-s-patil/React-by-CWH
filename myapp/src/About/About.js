                As Bootstrap 5 continues to mature, more and more styles will be built with CSS variables as a means to provide more real-time customization without the need to always recompile Sass. Our approach is to take our source Sass variables and transform them into CSS variables. That way, even if you donâ€™t use CSS variables, you still have all the power of Sass. This is still in-progress and will take time to fully implement.
